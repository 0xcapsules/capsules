// Example: I deposit $100 into a pool with $900, now $1,000. I get 10% of the pool's share,
// that is share = 100.
// The pool's value increases to $2,000. If I redeem my share, I get $200.

// What happens if the net_asset calculation is wrong? Over or under estimate?
// Can someone else arbitrage it into the right number?
// We don't want someone to drain it to 0 exploiting a miscalculation

// NAV (Net Asset Value) = net_assets / total_shares. This is the redemption value of 1 share,
// price in `A`

// TO DO: restrict who can deposit into a fund
// Users deposit currency into a Fund, and receive shares in return
// Shares can be bought and sold on an orderbook.
// Shares may trade at a premium or discount versus the fund's NAV
// Shares can be redeemed for the underlying currency at the fund's current NAV
// Fund-managers can restrict deposits or withdrawals
// They may restrict deposits + withdrawals to just certain parties, or they may restrict them
// altogether.
//
// Compared to TradeFi:
// - Mutual funds: anyone can deposit, anyone can withdraw. Occurs at end of trading day
// - Open-ended ETFs: only authorized participants (APs) can deposit or withdraw. APs acquire or sell
// shares on an open-market. Deposits and withdrawals occur at end of trading day.
// - Close-ended ETFs: after the initial IPO (deposits) no one can deposit or withdraw. Shares are not
// issued or destroyed. In the future, at the manager's discretion, they may do a secondary offering
// or buy-back shares if they are trading at a discount.

// Decisions:
// - Should fund-creators be allowed to use their own Supply<S>? This would be more flexible, but would open
// up the risk of them tying Supply<S> to some nonsense currency with multiple Supply<S> that they create.
// This is flexible, like Pool<CoinA, CoinB>, but also a potential abuse-vector.
// Answer: no
//
// - Should fund-managers be allowed to process deposits, but not withdrawals? This gives them more
// flexibility, but also opens up to potential abuse by fund-managers (again).
// Answer: no
