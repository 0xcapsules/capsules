Capsules is a set of general-purpose tools for managing ownership of virtual-currencies and virtual-items in Sui.

See [capsulecraft.dev](https://capsulecraft.dev) for more info.

A Capsule is a programmable unit of ownership. You can do fun stuff like attach data (data intended to be consumed by external applications) define ownership rights, and configure how ownership can be transferred, such as a non-tranferrable VS sellable on open markets.

Capsule's intended primary use-case is for Web3 Gaming and collectibles.
