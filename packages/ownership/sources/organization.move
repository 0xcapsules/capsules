// Organizations establish a single address that holds multiple packages within it. Such as a studio
// publishing multiple packages and then unifying all their server-actions underneath a single principal
// address.
// A Organization can store the RBAC records for an entire organization.
// The intent is that the Organization object will be owned by a master-key, which is a multi-sig wallet,
// stored safely offline, and then used to grant various admin keypairs to servers. The rights of these servers
// can be carefully scoped, and keypairs rotated in and out using the master-key.
//
// Organizations can also be used to delegate authority from a keypair to other addresses.
// A potential abuse vector is that a malicious actor could trick a user into mistakenly signing a
// organization::create() transaction, creating a Organization object for that user's keypair, while setting the
// malcious actor as the owner of it. If this were to occur, the malicious actor would have permanent control
// over the user's keypair. To prevent this, we disallow transferring ownership of Organization objects created
// outside of using a publish_receipt, and the owner is permanently the principal.
//
// Security note: the principal address of a organization is the object-id of the organization object.
// This is safe, because it is a 'shared object' and you cannot add the object-id to tx_authority by
// mere possession (reference) of the object.
//
// If you want to rotate the master-key for a organization, you can simply send the organization to a new
// address using OrgTransfer.
